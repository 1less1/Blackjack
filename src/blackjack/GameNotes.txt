Blackjack Game
By: Dom Olhava

-To Operate this Blackjack game. Please use the GameDriver Class
-You can edit the two players matching up and the amount of rounds to sim in the game constructor
-I have created three types of players:
    1. Atlantic City Dealer
    2. Dealer - Will hit hand until they are higher than the player or bust - Creates a lot of wins
    3. Counting Player - Counts cards using a discard pile functionality which gives the 1st player an edge over the 2nd player (dealer)

Extra Features Implemented:
-Discard Pile feature to allow players to count cards
-Clear and concise play by play printed within the console
-Easy to use game driver and I'd say decent OOD
